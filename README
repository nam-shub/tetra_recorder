tetra_recorder
==============

Description
-----------
This is a tool to record TETRA calls. It is meant as a replacement for SQ5BPF's
telive tool:
https://github.com/sq5bpf/telive

Many thanks to the osmocom guys for osmo-tetra for doing the heavy lifting here,
and to SQ5BPF for tirelessly filling in the blanks.

It will listen to a port and expect debug dumps from the hacked tetra-rx
processes. The tool is very basic, it can only dump voice calls. I wanted
something without GUI, and that was not written in C.

Things not implemented, because I don't see them on the networks I listen to:
* SDS text/data messages (or in fact any SDS processing)
* Location logging

This code is written from intuition looking at the TETRA messages and from
looking at the telive code. I have not read much of the ETSI specs, so there's
bound to be incorrect behavior.

Patches welcome!

Usage
-----
Follow the telive_doc.pdf for everything except the telive program itself.
Change the settings (PORTS, OUTPATH and FILENAME_TEMPLATE) at the top of
tetra_recorder.py. Unlike telive, it is possible to watch multiple TETRA
networks using one tetra_recorder process, just put multiple ports matching
the tetra-rx processes in PORTS.

If you want to run this headless like I do, you can change the GRC flowgraphs
to remove all the WX GUI elements, change the top_block type and run it through
'grcc' (part of gnuradio) to get a python script out.
